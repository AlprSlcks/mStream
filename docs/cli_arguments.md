As of v5-alpha there are only two arguments:

`--wizard` && `--json`

These both accept an argument of a config file
```
mstream -j /path/to/config.json
```

NOTE: v5 aims to simplify the setup process of mstream as much as possible.  I might remove the wizard in favor of Admin UI later in the development of v5.  If you have any opinions, let me know in the discord channel or on github.
