## Step 0 - Know your network

**Not all internet connections are equal.**

If you are connected to the internet with a 4g cell connection, this guide will not work! A 4g internet connection is not the same as cable connection to your home. The 4g connection will block all incoming connections to your computer.  A cable connection will allow incoming connections.

There's a small chance your internet service provider will block incoming connections to your ISP. This is unlikely, but it does happen.

**Know Your IP Address**

You will need to know your IP address to connect to your mStream server. You can find your IP address with https://www.whatsmyip.org/

**Your IP Address Can Change**

Your home internet connection most likely uses a Dynamic IP Address. This means your IP address can randomly change.

The good news is your IP address probably won't change unless you have a power outage.  But there is a chance that it might just change randomly on you.  Keep this in mind if you connection to your home server stops working.
